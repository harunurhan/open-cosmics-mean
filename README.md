### Open Cosmics: cosmic-ray physics for everyone

It is a project for CERN WebFest. You can find more info about the project [here](https://webfest.web.cern.ch/content/open-cosmics-cosmic-ray-physics-everyone)

This repository includes only NodeJS/Express based web app that communicates with MongoDB by using Mongoose and serves REST API & some generated (by using Jade templates) web pages and home page that is built with WebGL Earth.

##### RESULT: the project was selected as "Best Innovative Project of CERN WebFest 2015"

### Running 

- Change dbName and connectionString in **app.js** if you are using different dbName or a remotely hosted mongodb.
- `$node bin/www.js`Â then it will run on your host and will use 8000 port which can be changed in **bin/www.js**

### API

- GET /api/stations returns array of all stations
- GET /api/stations/station_id returns details of the station
- POST /api/stations posts new station to DB

### Roadmap and long term TODOs

- Port project to ES6
- Host the project (probably on Heroku)
